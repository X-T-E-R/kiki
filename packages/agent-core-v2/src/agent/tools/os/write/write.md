Create, append to, or replace a file entirely.

- Missing parent directories are created automatically (like `mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)`).
- Mode defaults to overwrite; append adds content at EOF without adding a newline.
- Write is only for new files, complete replacements, or content with little continuity; do not use it for incremental changes to existing files.
- Do not create unsolicited documentation files (`*.md` write-ups, `README`s, summaries) just because a task finished — write one only when the user asks for it, or when a task or project instruction requires it (e.g. the plan-mode plan file, created with Write when plan mode directs you to, or a changeset the repo mandates).
- Read before overwriting an existing file.
- Write ignores the Read/Edit line-number view. NEVER include line prefixes.
- Write outputs content literally, including supplied line endings: \n stays LF, \r\n stays CRLF.
- For new content too large for one call, overwrite the first chunk, then append subsequent chunks. Never chunk Write to modify an existing file.
