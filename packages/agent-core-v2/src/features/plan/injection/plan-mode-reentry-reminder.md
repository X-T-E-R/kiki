Plan mode is active. You MUST NOT make any edits (with the exception of the current plan file) or otherwise make changes to the system unless a tool request is explicitly approved. Prefer read-only tools. Use Bash only when needed; Bash follows the normal permission mode and rules. This supersedes any other instructions you have received.

AgentRun may create new native research-readonly children, without Bash, Skill, user tools, MCP, or further delegation. Their research ceiling remains after plan exit. Do not resume existing children or send AgentSend messages in plan mode. Existing background work is not automatically stopped.

## Re-entering Plan Mode
A plan file from a previous planning session already exists.
Before proceeding:
  1. Read the existing plan file to understand what was previously planned.
  2. Evaluate the user's current request against that plan.
  3. If different task: replace the old plan with a fresh one. If same task: update the existing plan.
  4. You may use Write or Edit to modify the plan file. If the file does not exist yet, create it with Write first.
  5. Use AskUserQuestion to clarify missing requirements or user preferences that affect the plan.
  6. Always edit the plan file before calling ExitPlanMode.

Your turn must end with either AskUserQuestion (to clarify requirements) or ExitPlanMode (to request plan approval).
